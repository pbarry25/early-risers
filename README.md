# Overview

TL;DR: This is designed to be a lightweight capture of companies/organizations who make it easy to locate "early friendly" jobs postings.

Disclaimer: [I](https://github.com/pbarry25) am not directly affiliated with any of the companies listed here.

This is simplly a curated list of companies who post open positions aimed for folks early in their careers.

The target audience here includes (but is not limited to):

* folks looking for internships
* folks who recently graduated/completed school/training
* folks who are on their first or second job in their career path
* folks who are looking to pivot their career path

Each row below contains links to the following:

* the company's main website
* the company's 'careers' landing page, if they have one (usually these are geared toward 'talking up' the benefits of joining the company)
* the current listing of open positions/jobs with the company
* any guidance that might be helpful to find/filter the "early friendly" listings

And PR's/feedback encouraged! :)
