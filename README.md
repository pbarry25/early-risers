# early-risers

Curated list of companies (mostly in the tech space) who have open positions for folks early in their careers. The target audience includes:

* folks looking for internships
* folks who recently graduated/completed school/training
* folks who are on their first or second job in their career path
* folks who are looking to pivot their career path

This is designed to be a light-weight capture of companies who make it easy to locate "early friendly" jobs postings.

PR's encouraged! :)
